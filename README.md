# üéØ Color Detection and Object Tracking using OpenCV

This project performs color detection and object tracking from a **video file** using the **HSV color space** with **OpenCV**. It detects specified colors and tracks their position across video frames, drawing a visual trail.

## üé® Color Ranges in HSV

| Color  | HSV Lower            | HSV Upper            |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Blue   | `[100, 150, 0]`      | `[140, 255, 255]`    |
| Yellow | `[22, 93, 0]`        | `[45, 255, 255]`     |
| Azure  | `[80, 100, 100]`     | `[100, 255, 255]`    |

> These can be changed in the `myColors` list inside the code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The program uses OpenCV to process each frame from a video. It converts the frame to the HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color space, which allows for more robust color filtering compared to RGB.  

For each predefined color, it creates a binary mask and detects contours to locate objects of that color. The center of the object is calculated and drawn onto the output frame. Over time, this creates a visual trail showing the object's movement.
