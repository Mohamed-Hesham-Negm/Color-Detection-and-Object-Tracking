# Color-Detection-and-Object-Tracking
This project detects specific colors (like blue or yellow) in a pre-recorded video, then tracks the position of the colored object frame by frame. It uses the HSV color space for accurate color filtering and draws a colored dot where the object appears. Over time, this creates a visual trail showing how the object moves.
